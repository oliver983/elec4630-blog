# Learning alorithms or  AI
Through learning this course we have been introduced to AI or mechiene learning, A few motable points are:
 - the concept Deep learning models dates back to the 1950s.
 * Unlike traditional programming, where instructions are written, machine learning enables computers to learn tasks from data.
 * Neural Networks are the foundation of deep learning, capable of learning patterns from large input data like images.
 *  mechine learning works by taking a searies of pre clasified inputs to train the artificial brain then it finds patterns in the inputs
 *  once the brain has been trianed, it works by breaking an input into parts then creating an output that is an average of the respoces of the supplied data to creat an output
 *  CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are a special type of neural network designed for processing visual data efficiently.
 *  Multi-modal Perception and Vision-language Understanding are current research frontiers, integrating visual and textual data
